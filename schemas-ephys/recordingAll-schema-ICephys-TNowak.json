From Ephys White Paper: 'At the beginning of every data sweep, a short test pulse was delivered to gauge whether the correct bridge balance setting was applied. Following every experiment, test pulses were checked by an independent observer and any sweeps that were deemed to have unsatisfactory bridge balance compensation (existence of a clear DC offset, relative to the test pulse from the first data trace, indicative of an increased access resistance) were failed from the data set.'
