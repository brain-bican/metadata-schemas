# BICAN Specimen Portal Metadata
This repository contains metadata that has been directly created first hand during the course of the design, rapid-prototyping, portal-driven requirement elicitation, testing, and production-scale implementation of BICAN specimen portal and sequencing portal using an agile development style. This set of metadata will be updated and released periodically, with an expected expanding scopes that may encompass donor info, brain specimen, brain slabs, tissue structure, library, and sequencing, as well as from different developmental stages of difference species.

The BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN) intends to adopt scalable technology platforms and streamlined sampling strategies and assay cascade to create comprehensive and highly granular brain cell atlases in human, non-human primates, mouse, and other species.

The Coordinating Unit for Biostatistics, Informatics, and Engagement (CUBIE) is to (i) enable the exploration of large-scale brain cell atlas data and knowledge, and inspire research in brain function and disorders; and (ii) ensure research rigor and data reproducibility by making the data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR), and the process transparent.

Credits: the metadata released here is developed through the collaboration of GQGroup from UTHealth with domain experts through individual and BICAN working group settings and task force settings. Leaders of such working groups and task forces include but are not limited to Drs. Ed Lein, Dirk Keene, and Lydia Ng. Addtional contributions from the National Neurobiobank are included in the metadata release. 

This effort is supported as a part of NIH award U24MH130988 (Zhang contact PI) for the BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network.
