### Controlled Vocabularies and Vocabulary Services

A vocabulary is a set of text representations of entities in a defined context. Terminology is a synonym for vocabulary. Vocabulary entries may include the textual representation (label) of the entry, synonyms, and a reference to a identifier. Ontology terms or database cross-references are examples of identifiers. Vocabularies may be related to data schemas and models as part of field specifications.

This repository documents the controlled vocabularies at use in BICAN, where to find them, and how to request new terms. 

## Atlases and Anatomical Structures

The [Allen Brain Atlases](https://atlas.brain-map.org) are the preferred atlases of the BICAN. They contain detailed maps and drawings of the anatomical structures referenced by BICAN. [UBERON](http://obophenotype.github.io/uberon/) is a species-agnostic anatomy ontology that is in use by many researchers. The Allen Brain Atlas structuregraphs have been mapped to UBERON [here](https://github.com/obophenotype/ABA_Uberon) to provide an easily-viewable and browseable ontology that combines the ABA and relevant elements of UBERON.

## Species Names and Taxon IDs

The [NCBI Taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) is the preferred species nomenclature for BICAN. Each species has an ID (NCBITaxon ID), a binomial name, and a common name. For purposes of data collecting in BICAN, the species ID is the most important piece of species information, as both binomial name and common name can be inferred from species ID (but not vice-versa).

For ease of browsing, there is a table in this repository that contains the controlled values that are used in BICAN.

## Specimen Types

Specimens are defined by the various BICAN specimens working groups and then formally vetted by the Metadata and Ontologies Working Group. Once vetted, BICAN-approved specimen types are documented in a table in this repository.

## Techniques

Techniques are identified via data submission and documented through [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io). Once we have data obtained via a technique, we then add the technique name and metadata to the table in this repository. 

## BICAN Project and Data Collection names

BICAN Project and Data Collection names and provided by BICAN projects directly as part of the data submission process. These are collected and documented in a table in this repository. 

# Workflows for CV updating/sharing across CUBIEs

The process for generating controlled vocabularies in BICAN is not unitary, but rather involves input from many different groups and stakeholders. However, a general process for publishing and sharing controlled vocuabularies has been developed by the BICAN Vocabulary Services Task Force and BICAN Metadata and Ontologies Working Group.
